# Heavy Water Angular UI Test

This project is intended to test your:
  1. ability to work with an existing code base
  1. knowledge of angular
  1. understanding how to convert business requests into code
  1. ability to develop code on you local and delpoy into a public cloud environment


## Business Requests

Scenario: you have just left this week's planning meeting. You have been give this list of requests from the product owner in priority order:

  1. Add something to show that the order list is either loading or blank due to no orders existing
  1. Make the search bar filter the order list based on any field showing in the list
  1. When a loan officer adds an order it should show up at the top of the list immediately
  1. Add auto-list refreshing from the server, aka if a value for an order changes on the server the list should display that change 
  1. Add unit tests for the code you wrote
  1. Add end-to-end tests for the code you wrote.
  1. Upgrade the angular version to the latest stable


## Measurement Criteria

  1. Did you complete the requests you said you completed? (*hint: better to leave something not done then claim its done if it isn't*)
  1. Did you complete the spirit of the request and not just the minimum?
  1. Did you use best practices in building, testing, deploying?
  

## Submitting Your Work
